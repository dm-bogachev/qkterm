RBWKRUT - Robowizard Kawasaki Robot Universal Terminal

This is a telnet-client for Kawasaki robot which supports LOAD and SAVE instructions (LOAD is working only for programs and variables. Everything, what requires confirmation leads to fail)
It's a fork of ludovicodepetris/qkterm as it is.

Only thing I did is translated "Connect" button and added a .pro file for simpler build
